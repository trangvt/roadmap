---------------------------------------------

A class diagram in the Unified Modeling Language (UML) 
+ is a type of `static structure diagram`
+ that describes the structure of a system by showing the system's classes, their attributes, operations (or methods), and the relationships among objects

# Compartments
In the diagram, classes are represented with boxes that contain three compartments (ngăn):
+ The top compartment
	contains the name of the class.
	It is printed in bold and centered (ThisIsMyClass)

+ The middle compartment 
	contains the attributes of the class (thisismyvariable)

+ The bottom compartment
	contains the operations the class can execute. (thisIsMyFunction())

## Members
UML provides mechanisms to represent class members, such as attributes and methods, and additional information about them like constructors.
