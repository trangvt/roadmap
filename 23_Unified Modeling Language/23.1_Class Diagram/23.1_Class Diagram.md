---------------------------------------------

A Class diagram in the Unified Modeling Language (UML) 
+ is a type of `static structure diagram`
+ that describes the structure of a system by showing the system's classes, their attributes, operations (or methods), and the relationships among objects

# Các thành phần
    1/ Class: Basic characteristic (class, attributes, methods) in a box that contain 3 compartments (khoang) 
    2/ Visibility
    3/ Relationships
    4/ Multiplicity

# 1/ Class
+ The top compartment
    contains the name of the class.
    It is printed in bold and centered (ThisIsMyClass)

+ The middle compartment 
    contains the attributes (fields, variables, properties) of the class (thisismyvariable)

+ The bottom compartment
    contains the operations (functions, methods) the class can execute. (thisIsMyFunction())

# 2/ Visibility
    Public      +
        Can be accessed by any other class
    Private     -
        Can be accessed by other class or subclass
    Protected   #
        Can only be accessed by the same class or its subclasses
    Package     ~
        Can be used by any other class as long as it's in the same package

# 3/ Relationships
    Inheritance
    Association
    Aggreation
    Composition

# 4/ Multiplicity
    0..1    : zero to one (optional)
    n       : specific number
    0..*    : zero to many
    1..*    : one to many
    m..n    : specific number range
